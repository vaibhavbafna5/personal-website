                    Hi - my name is Vaibhav (`VY-BUV`) & I'm a software engineer based in Brooklyn, NY.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Previously, I worked at Lyft, where I helped predict and incentivize upcoming rides. I also worked on 
                    walking optimization, improving search, and denoising inaccurate GPS location. Prior to Lyft, I studied Computer Science at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I quit working at Lyft in August of 2022 for a much-needed break & I'm currently working part-time as a bike mechanic while consulting for a startup.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I enjoy greenfield development, building things from scratch, rapid prototyping, and solving tough, real-world problems.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    Hi, my name is Vaibhav (`VY-BUV`).
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I'm currently a Member of Technical Staff at <a href="https://radical-ai.com/">Radical AI</a>, an early stage materials science R&D company. We're building a closed loop process that integrates high-throughput molecular quantum mechanics, atomistic predictive modeling and generative approaches, and a fully self-driving lab with automated synthesis and characterization. My role extends across the stack, ranging from high-performance computing for our simulations to robotics in the lab.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Iâ€™m interested in true systems engineering, high-performance applications (embedded & distributed), and scientific computing. Ultimately, I enjoy greenfield development, building things from scratch, rapid prototyping, and solving tough, real-world problems.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Before joining Radical, I was a software engineer at Volta Labs, a bio-automation startup. My role spanned the entire stack, encompassing high-performance firmware development using C/C++ & Rust, instrument control software in Python, and lightweight frontend work with React and Redux.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Prior to Volta, I worked at Lyft, where I helped predict and incentivize upcoming rides. I also worked on walking optimization, improving search, and de-noising inaccurate GPS locations.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I graduated from the University of Michigan, where I studied Computer Science and had the privilege of being a Co-Director at <a href="https://shiftcreator.space/"><u>Shift Creator Space</u></a>. 
                    <br />
